This document list out all configurations and things that need to be known about this Hello World app we are creating for the Leap Motion device.

## This project environment

It is recommended that we start working on this as a JavaScript project. That way we can code independent of OS and browser (apart from browser bugs). It would allow for maximum collaboration across different platforms and possibly feed nicely into any web project we currently have. 

**Project language:** JavaScript

Additionally any visualization technique that is chosen can be seen as an investment in that technology. For instance we could use Three.js or ProcessingJS or simply get to know the canvas object a whole better by rendering on that directly without any of the frameworks.

**Visualization frameworks:**

 * Three.js - (http://threejs.org)
 * ProcessingJS - (http://processingjs.org/)
